# Project Retrospective

## Overview

Generate a "How I Built This" guide at the end of a project. Reviews the collaboration history and extracts key prompts, decisions, and iterations into two outputs:

1. **Project doc** (`docs/how-i-built-this.md`) - Lives with the code
2. **Shareable guide** - Formatted for social sharing/teaching

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the project-retrospective skill to document how we built this."

## The Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. Review conversation history for:
   - Initial inspiration/request
   - Brainstorming questions and answers
   - Key decision points
   - Iteration feedback
   - Feature additions
   - Problems and solutions

2. Check project files:
   - README for project description
   - Design docs in `docs/plans/`
   - Git history for milestones

### Step 2: Extract the Story

Identify these elements:

| Element | What to Find |
|---------|--------------|
| **Inspiration** | How the project started (link, idea, problem) |
| **Tech choices** | Stack decisions and why |
| **Key prompts** | Exact user messages that drove progress |
| **Iterations** | Feedback loops and improvements |
| **Pivots** | When direction changed and why |
| **Wins** | What worked well |
| **Challenges** | Problems encountered and solutions |

### Step 3: Generate Both Outputs

**Output 1: Project Documentation**

Save to `docs/how-i-built-this.md` with this structure:

- How I Built [Project Name]
- The Idea: How the project started
- Tech Stack Decisions: What I chose and why
- The Build Process: Phases with key prompts
- Iterations & Improvements: Feedback and changes
- Challenges & Solutions: Problems and fixes
- Key Prompts That Worked: Table of effective prompts
- Lessons Learned: What worked, what I'd change

**Output 2: Shareable Guide**

Format for sharing (display directly, copy-paste ready):

- Compelling hook about what I built
- My approach and methodology
- The prompts that worked (table format)
- Key lessons (numbered list)
- Quick start template for others
- Project link and tech stack

### Step 4: Commit Documentation

After generating, commit the project doc to git.

### Step 5: Update Portfolio Website

If this is a shareable/demo-able project, add it to the portfolio:

1. **Copy project files** to `../mywebsite/<project-name>/`
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ../mywebsite/<project-name>
   cp index.html ../mywebsite/<project-name>/
   # Copy any other required assets
   ```

2. **Update portfolio.html** in `../mywebsite/`:
   - Add new project entry at the TOP of the projects-list
   - Format:
   ```html
   <div class="project-item">
       <p class="project-name">→ <a href="https://michaelguo.vercel.app/<project-name>" class="link" target="_blank">🎯 Project Name</a></p>
       <p class="project-desc">One-line description of what it does</p>
       <p class="project-tech">Tech / Stack / Used</p>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Commit changes** to the mywebsite repo:
   ```bash
   cd ../mywebsite
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add <project-name> to portfolio"
   ```

4. **Deploy** (if using Vercel, push triggers auto-deploy)

**Skip this step if:**
- Project is not demo-able (CLI tool, library, etc.)
- Project contains sensitive/private code
- User explicitly says not to publish

## Writing Style

**CRITICAL: Use first person throughout**
- CORRECT: "I started by..." / "We built..." / "My approach was..."
- WRONG: "You should..." / "The user did..." / "Your project..."

**Tone:**
- Conversational and authentic
- Celebrate wins without bragging
- Honest about challenges
- Practical and actionable for readers

**For the shareable version:**
- More casual, social-media friendly
- Include emojis sparingly
- Focus on "here's how others can do this too"
- End with encouragement

## Key Principles

- **Extract real prompts** - Use exact quotes when possible
- **Show the iteration** - The messy middle is valuable
- **Be honest about failures** - What didn't work teaches too
- **Make it reproducible** - Others should be able to follow
- **First person always** - This is the builder's story
